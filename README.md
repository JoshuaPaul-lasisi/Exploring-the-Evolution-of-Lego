# Exploring the Evolution of Lego

## Project Overview

Lego, the iconic toy brand, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years, with the introduction of licensed sets becoming a crucial factor in its survival and success. As a Data Analyst at Lego, you have been tasked with providing specific information to the Account Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership, in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team. This is an unguided Datacamp Project.

The two key questions you need to answer are:

1. **What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?** Save your answer as a variable `the_force` in the form of an integer (e.g., 25).

2. **In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?** Save your answer as a variable `new_era` in the form of an integer (e.g., 2012).

To answer these questions, you will be working with two datasets:

1. **lego_sets.csv**: This dataset contains information about individual Lego sets, including the set number, name, year of release, number of parts, theme name, and parent theme.
2. **parent_themes.csv**: This dataset provides information about the parent themes, including whether the theme is licensed or not.

## Data Exploration and Manipulation

Your task is to explore and manipulate the existing data to answer the two questions. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing various calculations and analyses.

## Key Findings

1. **Percentage of licensed sets that were Star Wars themed**: `the_force`
2. **Year when Star Wars was not the most popular licensed theme**: `new_era`

## Conclusion

By answering these two questions, you will provide the Account Executive with valuable insights into the evolution of Lego's licensed sets, particularly the importance of the Star Wars partnership and the emergence of other popular licensed themes over time. This information can be used to inform strategic decisions and negotiations with the Star Wars team.

Remember, the method you use to arrive at the answers is up to you, but keep in mind that the dataset may require some cleaning and handling of missing values to ensure the reliability of your results.
